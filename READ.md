## Environment Configuration

Before launching the application, it is necessary to configure the following environment variables to ensure secure database connections:

- `DB_USERNAME` - The username for database access.
- `DB_PASSWORD` - The password for database access.
- `DB_HOST` - The database host (default `localhost`).
- `DB_PORT` - The port on which the database is running (default `5432`).
- `DB_NAME` - The name of the database (default `yourDatabase`).

These variables can be set in the operating system or through an environment configuration file used to launch the application.
